This is a demo program for PCM_Modbus arduino based controller

This program uses open source code and is based on the tui.c example from PDCurses library.
Original authors credits are still contained with in tui.h, tui.cpp.
Many features have been added to this library, but it is fundimently the same menu based program.
My thinks to the origional author.
